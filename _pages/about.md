As a Computer Scientist actively developing my career skills, I'm driven by a deep fascination with the potential of technology to solve complex problems. My core technical interests lie in **Machine Learning** and **Reinforcement Learning**, areas where I'm constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and apply innovative approaches. I thrive on the challenge of understanding intricate systems and building intelligent solutions.

## Beyond the Code

While my professional focus is on computation and algorithms, my life outside of work is equally dynamic and shapes who I am. I'm passionate about sports that demand both physical and mental acuity. **Fencing** hones my strategic thinking, precision, and ability to react under pressure, while **Rugby** teaches me the power of teamwork, resilience, and communication. In both arenas, I embrace opportunities to **lead**, finding satisfaction in motivating a team towards a common goal, whether on the pitch or in collaborative projects.

This blend of analytical thinking and active engagement extends to how I approach challenges. I believe the discipline learned through sports directly complements the problem-solving required in computer science. Both require understanding rules (or parameters), strategizing within constraints, and adapting to rapidly changing situations – much like developing an effective RL agent.

Continuous learning is fundamental to my growth. While I delve into technical papers and explore new algorithms in ML and RL, I also value broader perspectives gained through reading and engaging with diverse ideas. Staying curious and open-minded is key to innovation, both in technology and in life.

Spending time with supportive family and friends remains incredibly important. These relationships ground me and provide perspective, reminding me of the values I hold close – integrity, perseverance, and collaboration. These values are not just personal principles; they guide my approach to my work and my interactions within any team.

Ultimately, my journey is fueled by a passion for what I do, both intellectually and personally. Whether tackling a complex coding problem, strategizing on the fencing strip, or leading on the rugby field, I bring dedication and a commitment to my core values. These combined experiences drive my pursuit of excellence as a Computer Scientist and as an individual.
